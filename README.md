# FLAMES_Game_C
Description: A C programming project simulating the FLAMES game. It features two sub-projects: one randomly selects male and female names to calculate their compatibility score, while the other compares names from two files to find the top 5 matches with scores. Fun and interactive way to explore name compatibility!
